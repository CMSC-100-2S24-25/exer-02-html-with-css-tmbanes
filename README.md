Steps on how to create a Githubpage:
1. Create or join a repository on GitHub
2. Clone the repository on your local computer/laptop
3. Add and push the html file to the GitHub repository
4. Go to GitHub Pages under the repository settings and select which branch that will be used to show your html file
