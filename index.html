                    Autobiography<br>
                    <p style="justify-content: center;">My name is Trisha Elaine M. Banes, a BS Computer Science degree holder from 
                    University of the Philippines-Los Banos. My interst with web programming started when 
                    HTML was introduced to me in high school at 7th grade in our Computer subject. It is 
                    what pushed me to  pursue a degree program in Computer Science. By combining passion,
                    interest, and skills, I am able to manage and create webpages that are fit for clients
                    and their visions for their websites.
